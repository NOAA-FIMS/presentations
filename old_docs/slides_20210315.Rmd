# Software development lifecycle (SDLC)

The SDLC provides an international standard that software companies can use to build and improve their computer programs. It offers a defined structure for development teams to follow in the design, creation and maintenance of high-quality software. The aim of the IT software development process is to build effective products within a defined budget and timeline.

# Requirements gathering

# Why do requirements gathering?
- Requirements documentation serves as a point of reference to document the evolution of a project, its moving parts, and its implementation
- Requirements documentation serves as a blueprint for the client to better understand what to expect out of the project (the what, where, when, and why of the project).

# Functional vs non functional requirements
- *functional requirements* what the system should do (e.g. estimate biomass)
- *non functional requirements* how the system should do it (e.g. usability, performance)

# How to do this in your centers
- Meet with groups in your centers and document the requirements for their species/councils
- Review documentation to be sure everything is explicitly captured


---
# What comes next?
- Prioritizing and scoping the list of requirements
- Goal is to define a *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)*
- Implementation plan for phase 1 design and development is MVP
- Requirements that are identified but not in phase 1 move to the next phase
