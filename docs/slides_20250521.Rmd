- I’ve been learning about software testing since 2020.

--
- I’d like to share what has and hasn’t worked well for testing in the FIMS project.

--
- The examples I’ll present focus on R and C++ code developed by the FIMS implementation team (.hyperlink-style[[https://noaa-fims.github.io/FIMS/authors.html](https://noaa-fims.github.io/FIMS/authors.html)]).

--
- Comments and suggestions are very welcome!

# Test design and evaluation

- Use snapshot tests (also known as .hyperlink-style[[golden tests](https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-12-04-golden-tests)]) to capture FIMS output in human-readable files and track changes over time
- Use test fixtures to supply input data and expected results to multiple tests, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability
- Use built-in functions (e.g., expect_equal()) to compare computed values against known reference values (e.g., unit tests or deterministic integration tests)
- Relax tolerance criteria for model estimates: ensure that no more than 5% of estimates deviate from expected values by more than 2 standard errors (e.g., estimation tests)

---
# Test coverage and reporting
- Use Codecov to track and report code coverage
- Rely on coverage metrics from the R side, as R code also triggers the underlying C++ code
- Coverage has remained between 65% and 95% since 2022
- Coverage changes are automatically reported in each pull request
